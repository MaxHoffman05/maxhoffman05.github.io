                    My portfolio showcases my programming skills across many different languages including: C++, Java, Python, SQL, and R.
                    I focus mainly on back-end coding languages, but I am open to exploring front-end languages like Javascript. 
                    These are some of my favorite projects listed below and a link to my github portfolio can be found to the left if you would like to explore them, or more of my projects, further.
                </p>

                <p>I liked this project because it taught me the basics on how compilers interpret tokens and how grammar syntax is defined.</p>

                <p>This project was very interesting, since it was the first time I worked with Semaphores I liked how intuitive the code felt.</p>
                <a href="https://github.com/MaxHoffman05/Portfolio/tree/main/pythonProjects/IoTFinalProject" class="projLinks"><li>> Internet of Things Final Project</li></a>
                <p>This was one of my favorite classes I took at Lindenwood. I liked learning the hardware side and seeing code interact with hardware. This final project I made a system of keeping track of water temperature and water kh and gh in an aquarium.</p>
                <a href="https://github.com/MaxHoffman05/Portfolio/tree/main/C%2B%2BProjects/terminalCommandShellProject" class="projLinks"><li>> Terminal Project</li></a>
                <p>This project was very difficult but rewarding. I didn't know how this was possible before completing the project being able to execute console commands with code.</p>

            <h2>Senior Capstone Project - TailTracker</h2>
            <img src="assets/images/tailTracker.png">
            <p>
                For my Senior Capstone Project I worked in a group as a back-end coder and the project documentor. 
                We worked in an Agile Team to complete the project on time with all the features our client wanted.
                We chose Javascript for the front-end and Python and Python Flask for the back-end. Our client needed
                a solution to helping her create Dog Agility Competition Schedules easier and faster. We were tasked with automating this process.
            </p>
            <p>
                My responsibilities for the back-end were to create a way to parse through input excel files and calculate time alloted 
                for each Dog Agility Class, in order to build out the schedule for the whole Dog Competition. Me and 
                another teammate were also tasked with creating the API routes for the front end to access the back-end 
                through Python Flask. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I was also tasked with documenting all project methodologies, project tools, and explaining my team's though processes into a documentation binder.
                I made many charts, images, edited screenshots, to illustrate how my team completed the project. This documentation binder had multiple parts, the most important being the User Manual, and the Technical Manual. The User Manual had to explain how 
                to use our application to anyone, including someone who may not have much comptuer experience. The Technical Manual focused on explaining how our project worked to another development team and to give them all the tools they would need if someone 
                else needed to maintain the project. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe this project helped me prepare for the real world and allowed me to strengthen and grow new skills like
                documentation and the Agile Method. If you are interested in looking at a copy of the documentation binder 
                or any code I developed for this project, please contact me on linkedIn, and I can provide a copy of either!
