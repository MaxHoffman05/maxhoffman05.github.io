## Approach

I made this Github Pages Website with HTML and CSS with a little JavaScript.

Its made up of four pages:

    - index.html
    - resume.html
    - projects.html
    - recentProjs.html

The navigation bar and footer bar are stored separately in HTML files: nav.html and footer.html.

I enjoyed working on this project and designing the pages. I'd like to do more front-end work since most of my previous projects have been done in the back-end and that is what I am most comfortable with.

This was also the first project I used ChatGPT to help me design and style the website. I haven't had the opportunity to use ChatGPT in school so it was interesting seeing different ideas brought up and implemented by ChatGPT that I wanted.

I already had learned HTML and CSS but it was nice to refresh my knowledge especially of things I hadn't used before like flexbox and transitions/animations.
