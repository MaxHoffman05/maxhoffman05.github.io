                    <p>I have been working on learning C# and ASP.NET recently. I wanted to start learning C# before learning ASP.NET,
                        so based on a recommendation from a video I watched I created a small console application project
                        to get used to C#. I asked ChatGPT for a good beginner C# project while keeping in mind my coding
                        background. My goal for this project was to learn C# syntax and basics, as well as learn new concepts in C#.

                <p>
                    I developed this short Python script to semi-automate the process of creating cover letters. I knew that my previous method of creating cover letters could be 
                    improved and I could cut down on the work I knew could be automated. Examples of this include: automatically importing the date, changing the name of the company 
                    and position in my opening paragraph. Another reason I wanted to create this script was so I could store and display all the different cover letter paragraphs I 
                    have previously written to make them more easily accessible if they were applicable to a job I am currently applying for. I made this to be able to focus all my 
                    effort on creating the best cover letter instead of changing dates, company names etc.
